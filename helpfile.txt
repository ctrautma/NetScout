When the ACK PORT ALARMS ALL command is issued, then via a \r\n           single command to each switch the server requests that the switch re-arm\r\n           all port alarms that the switch had previously disabled due to reporting of \r\n           that alarm to the server.  If the switch reports successful completion of the \r\n           re-arm command, then the UCS server moves all of that switch\'s port alarms from\r\n           the port alarm current log to the port alarm history log.  The latter command \r\n           should be used after switching from the primary server to the backup server.  It\r\n           may also be used to determine the current alarm status of all connected ports.\r\n           NOTE: If PORt is used specify the port name, if PRTNum is used specify the port number as cc.ss.pp\r\n           NOTE: PRTNUM is only valid on an embedded server unless the Select Switch command has been issued.\r\n     Ex:   ACK POR ALA \'BLZ 1.2.4\'\r\n           ack por ala all\r\n  \r\n  Usage:   ACKnowledge SYStem ALArms {ALL|switch name}\r\n           Acknowledge all system alarms or system alarms for a specific switch. This command can\r\n           be issued  for all switches via the ALL parameter or  on a switch basis by specifying \r\n           the switch name.  Per port alarms, those system alarms that can be considered to have a \r\n           bad/abnormal state, for example, power supply xx on CC yy is offline.

The PORT or PRTNUM option will \r\n           reconnect a connected port and disconnect a disconnected port. Reconciling ports \r\n           on a switch will allow the user to ensure that the switch contains all the connections that \r\n           the server has.  This is useful after a database restore.  \r\n           NOTE: PRTNUM is only valid on an embedded server unless the Select Switch command has been issued.\r\n     Ex:   rec SWI NYSE \r\n           reconcile port "SW1 01.01.15" \r\n           recon prtn 1.1.2 \r\n  \r\n  Usage:   REName {PORt|PRTNum} port newportname\r\n           Rename the specified port.  newportname is always a port name.\r\n           NOTE: If PORt is used specify the port name, if PRTNum is used specify the port number as cc.ss.pp\r\n           NOTE: PRTNUM is only valid on an embedded server unless the Select Switch command has been issued.\r\n     Ex:   ren por \'Blz 1.2.4\' \'Blz 2GFC 1.2.4\'\r\n  \r\n  Usage:   RESEt PASsword userid\r\n           Reset a user\'s password.\r\n     Ex:   rese pas tester\r\n  \r\n  Usage:   RESEt STATS PCE {PORt|PRTNum} [*|name[,name...]]  \r\n           Reset the real time statistics counters to zero on the specified PCE port.\r\n           The PCE port must have been previously started.\r\n     Ex:   reset stats pce prtnum 1.1.PCE1\r\n           reset stats pce port dedup1\r\n  \r\n  Usage:   RESEt STATS {PORt|PRTNum} [*|name[,name...]]  \r\n           Reset the real time statistics counters to zero on the specified port(s) or subport(s).\r\n           The port(s) or subport(s) must have been previously started.\r\n           The wildcard (*) resets all stats that have been previously started.\r\n           NOTE: If PORt is used specify the port name, if PRTNum is used specify the port number as cc.ss.pp\r\n           NOTE: PRTNUM is only valid on an embedded server unless the Select Switch command has been issued.\r\n     Ex:   reset stats port SpanA\r\n           RESET STATS prtnum "1.1.1, 1.1.2.1, 1.1.3.2"\r\n           rese stats port SpanBTx,SpanBRx\r\n           reset stats port *\r\n  \r\n  Usage:   RESTore BACkup specification\r\n           Restore backup database from the location specification.
